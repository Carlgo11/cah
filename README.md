### A Cards Against Humanity Clone.
> _Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends._
_The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card._

## Q & A
* __Why?__
I haven't found anywhere to play Cards Against Humanity online that's good enough. There are sites like [pretendyoure.xyz](https://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/) and [azala.info](https://azala.info/static/index.html) but they are limited in some way. pretendyoure.xyz does not allow blank cards and azala.info has a player/game limit.

* __Why this language/framework?__
Because Angular and Typescript are what I'm most familiar with. :man_shrugging:

* __Can i host my own verison of this?__
Yes. Clone the repository and run `scripts/setup.sh`. You should now have the game running on port 5000. For more info see [setup](setup.md).

* __Why is it called *Chickens Attach Helicopters*?__
*"We own the name "Cards Against Humanity," so you have to call your crappy thing something else."* - CAH Team

### Enjoy! :tada:
